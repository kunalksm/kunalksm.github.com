> We held a weekly forecast call where Mark reviewed every deal in front
> of the entire 150 person sales force. On one such call, a salesperson
> described an account that he’d forecast in detail: “I have buy-in
> from my champion, the vice president that he reports to, and the head
> of purchasing. My champion assures me that they’ll be able to complete
> the deal by the end of the fiscal quarter.”  

> Mark quickly replied, “Have you spoken to the vice president’s peer
> in the networking group?”

> Sales rep: “Um, no I haven’t.”  

> Mark: “Have you spoken to the vice president yourself?”

> Sales rep: “No.”

> Mark: “Okay, listen carefully. Here’s what I’d like you to do. First,
> reach up to your face and take off your rose-colored glasses. Then
> get a Q-tip and clean the wax out of your ears. Finally, take off your
> pink panties and call the fucking vice president right now, because you do
> not have a deal.”

> Mark was right. It turned out that we did not have a deal,
> as the vice president’s peer in networking was blocking it. We eventually got
> a meeting with him and won the deal.

> More important, Mark set the tone: **Sloppiness would not be tolerated.**
